**Individual Project Report**

_Introduction:_

This project analyzes the attributes of popular songs on Spotify in 2023. The data captured can identify certain music trends and can be used to predict the success of similar songs before debuting. These analyses provide insights into streaming trends, artist popularity, genre preferences, and the relationship between musical features and streaming success on Spotify in 2023. This data can be valuable to upcoming artists, established artists, and music labels wanting to grow in their numbers. 

_Dataset:_

I used the data from Kaggle called, "Most Streamed Songs 2023." This dataset listed information about streams for released songs under different categories such as danceability, energy, and acoustics. It also provided insights into each song's attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms. To make sure that the data was accurate to analyze, it was processed and cleaned.

_Initial Questions:_ 

1. What are the top streamed songs of 2023?
2. What are the top songs to be saved in playlists on Spotify?
3. What are the top most energic songs on Spotify?
4. What are the top songs that are the most acoustic?
5. How does the rank of popular songs correlate to how often it is saved on a Spotify playlist? 

_Methodology:_
I imported the song data from the "Most Streamed Songs 2023" file and preprocessed the data for analysis. To compare the different areas of streamed music, I used bar graphs, a histogram, and a scatter plot. The statistical method such as Pearson correlation was used to explore the relationships between streams and type of song. 

_Results:_

For the top songs of 2023, I did not expect the Weeknd to have two songs in the top 10. Since Taylor Swift has risen in popularity over the past few months, I expected her songs to be featured on that list. Blinding Lights was placed on two of the graphs I made for the top songs and top songs saved on spotify playlists. I was also surprised to see that there was such a wide variety of genres highlighted. The number two song, Murder in My Mind, is a popular song used on TikTok videos. It is interesting to see how social media platforms can affect the song charts in such a strong way. 

_Questions Answered:_
1. The most streamed song in 2023 was Blinding Lights by the Weeknd
2. The top song to be put in a Spotify playlist is Get Lucky
3. There was a tie for the most energic song: I'm Good (Blue) and Murder in My Mind
4. There was a tie for the most acoustic song: Sweet Nothing and The Night We Met
5. 

_Future Work Discussion:_

Since this data was focused on Spotify, I would want to look into the streams on Apple Music. By comparing the data from Spotify and Apple Music, I would be able to see if there were any drastic differences. I also would want to look into the total music streams internationally. The dataset I looked at was mainly American artists. I am curious to see what is trending in other countries.
